# xft
- xft is a functional transformation framework for accelerating numerical computing in Python, inspired by the elegance and power of JAX.

## Goal:
- Our mission is to explore, learn from, and extend the core ideas that make JAX so effective, providing a transparent and educational codebase for those interested in the internals of modern machine learning frameworks.
- A primary goal of `xft` is to have a codebase that is easy to read, understand, and learn from. We want to demystify how modern ML frameworks work under the hood.

## Contributions
- `xft` is an open and collaborative project, and we warmly welcome contributions of all kinds! Whether you are a seasoned compiler engineer or a student just starting your journey, there is a place for you here.
- We believe that the best way to learn is by doing, and we are committed to creating a friendly and supportive environment for all contributors.
